# OAuth Critical Fix Deployment Checklist

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Railway Backend Update
- [ ] Deploy updated `railway-oauth-complete/` directory
- [ ] Verify `/api/oauth/auth` endpoint is included
- [ ] Test endpoint availability: `curl https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/auth`

### 2. Environment Variables Verification
- [ ] `GHL_CLIENT_ID` - Set in Railway
- [ ] `GHL_CLIENT_SECRET` - Set in Railway  
- [ ] `GHL_REDIRECT_URI` - Set to `https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback`
- [ ] `GHL_SCOPES` - Must include `users.read` for user info retrieval

### 3. GoHighLevel App Configuration
- [ ] Add `users.read` to OAuth scopes in GoHighLevel developer console
- [ ] Update redirect URI to match Railway domain
- [ ] Verify app is active and properly configured

### 4. Testing Verification
- [ ] Run `./oauth-critical-test.sh` to verify endpoints
- [ ] Test OAuth flow with real GoHighLevel account
- [ ] Verify "Try Again" button works on error page
- [ ] Confirm user info retrieval succeeds

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Endpoint
Frontend error page retry mechanism calls `/api/oauth/auth` but Railway backend only provides `/api/oauth/status`.

### Secondary Issue: OAuth Configuration
"user_info_failed" error suggests:
- Missing `users.read` scope
- Incorrect API endpoint configuration
- Token refresh mechanism problems

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No more 404 errors on retry attempts
- [ ] "user_info_failed" errors resolved
- [ ] Complete OAuth flow works end-to-end
- [ ] User info displays correctly after authentication

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Revert to previous Railway deployment
2. Update frontend to use `/api/oauth/status` instead of `/api/oauth/auth`
3. Implement proper OAuth initiation flow

The fix addresses both the missing endpoint issue and the underlying OAuth configuration problems.
