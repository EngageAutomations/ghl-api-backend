# Railway User Endpoint Fix v2.2.1

## Issue Fixed
The GoHighLevel user API endpoint "/users/me" was returning "User id me not found" error.

## Solution
Updated to use multiple endpoint attempts:
1. Primary: https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/users/search
2. Fallback: https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/userinfo

## Deployment
Replace your Railway index.js with railway-fixed-user-endpoint.js

## Test
Your authorization code should now work:
