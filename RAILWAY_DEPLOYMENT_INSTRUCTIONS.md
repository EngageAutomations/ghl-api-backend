# Railway Modular Backend Deployment Instructions

## Quick Deployment Steps

The Railway Modular Upgrade is ready for deployment. This fixes the OAuth "authenticated: false" errors by replacing the monolithic structure with proper modular Express routes.

### 1. Upload Files to GitHub Repository

Replace your current Railway repository contents with the files from `railway-deploy-final/`:

```
railway-deploy-final/
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js                 # Entry point (replaces index.js)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # Updated dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.toml              # Deployment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js                # Main Express application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ oauth.js          # Fixed OAuth token exchange
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ media.js          # Location-centric media upload
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ products.js       # Location-centric product creation
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ legacy.js         # Backward compatibility
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ install-store.js  # Installation management
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ token-refresh.js  # Token refresh utilities
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Railway

**CRITICAL:** Add these environment variables in your Railway dashboard:

```
CLIENT_ID=your_gohighlevel_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_gohighlevel_client_secret
```

### 3. Deploy and Verify

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Railway will automatically deploy the modular backend
3. Check deployment logs for: `ðŸš€ GHL proxy (modular) listening on 0.0.0.0:3000`
4. Verify health endpoint shows: `"version": "1.5.0-modular"`

### 4. Test OAuth Flow

1. Install/reinstall your app from GoHighLevel marketplace
2. OAuth should redirect to: `https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback?code=...`
3. Backend will exchange authorization code for tokens
4. Redirect to: `https://listings.engageautomations.com/?installation_id=install_...`
5. Frontend will capture installation_id and fetch locationId
6. Product creation should work via location-centric endpoints

## Key Fixes

### Before (Monolithic)
- OAuth callback returns "OAuth failed" (500 error)
- Token exchange doesn't work properly
- All installations show `authenticated: false`
- Product creation fails

### After (Modular)  
- OAuth callback properly exchanges authorization code for tokens
- Installations stored with `authenticated: true` and valid `locationId`
- Location-centric API routing works correctly
- AI Robot Assistant Pro creation successful

## Expected Logs

Once deployed with OAuth credentials, you should see:

```
Config check: { CLIENT_ID: '[set]', CLIENT_SECRET: '[set]', REDIRECT: '/api/oauth/callback', PORT: 3000 }
ðŸš€ GHL proxy (modular) listening on 0.0.0.0:3000
ðŸ“‹ Routes registered:
   - OAuth: /api/oauth/callback, /api/oauth/status
   - Media: /api/ghl/locations/:locationId/media
   - Products: /api/ghl/locations/:locationId/products
   - Legacy: /api/ghl/products/create (deprecated)
   - Health: /, /health
âœ… Ready for OAuth installation flow
```

## Troubleshooting

If OAuth still fails after deployment:
1. Verify CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET are correctly set
2. Check GoHighLevel app redirect URI: `https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback`
3. Review Railway deployment logs for OAuth callback errors
4. Test with OAuth status endpoint: `/api/oauth/status?installation_id=...`

This modular upgrade should resolve the authentication issues and enable the complete OAuth workflow for AI Robot Assistant Pro creation.
