# Deploy Modular Railway Backend

## Quick Deployment Guide

The Railway Modular Upgrade has been completed and is ready for deployment. Here's how to deploy it to fix the OAuth authentication issues:

### 1. Copy Modular Code to Railway

Upload the contents of `railway-modular/` to your Railway deployment:

```
railway-modular/
├── server.js                 # Entry point
├── package.json              # Dependencies
├── src/
│   ├── app.js                # Main Express app
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── oauth.js          # Fixed OAuth token exchange
│   │   ├── media.js          # Location-centric media upload
│   │   ├── products.js       # Location-centric product creation
│   │   └── legacy.js         # Backward compatibility
│   └── utils/
│       ├── install-store.js  # Installation management
│       └── token-refresh.js  # Token refresh utilities
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

**CRITICAL:** Set these in Railway environment:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=your_gohighlevel_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_gohighlevel_client_secret
```

### 3. Deploy and Test

1. Deploy to Railway
2. Verify health endpoint: `https://dir.engageautomations.com/`
3. Should show `"version": "1.5.0-modular"`
4. Test OAuth flow from GoHighLevel marketplace

### 4. Expected Behavior

**Before Modular Upgrade:**
- OAuth callback returns "OAuth failed" (500 error)
- Token exchange doesn't work
- All installations show `authenticated: false`

**After Modular Upgrade:**
- OAuth callback properly exchanges authorization code for tokens
- Installations stored with `authenticated: true` and valid `locationId`
- Product creation works with location-centric endpoints
- AI Robot Assistant Pro creation successful

### 5. Testing the Fix

Once deployed with OAuth credentials:

1. Install/reinstall app from GoHighLevel marketplace
2. OAuth redirect: `https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback?code=...`
3. Token exchange completes successfully
4. Redirect to: `https://listings.engageautomations.com/?installation_id=install_...`
5. Frontend captures installation_id and fetches locationId
6. Product creation works via location-centric endpoints

### Key Improvements

- **Fixed Token Exchange:** Proper OAuth authorization code handling
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Clear logging for OAuth issues
- **Modular Structure:** Prevents code truncation issues
- **Location-Centric API:** Clean separation of endpoints by location
- **Automatic Token Refresh:** Maintains authentication without user intervention
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Environment variable checks and error messages

This modular upgrade should resolve the `authenticated: false` errors and enable the complete OAuth workflow for AI Robot Assistant Pro creation.
