# OAuth Redirect Fix Solution

## Issue Analysis

Your OAuth installation succeeded perfectly - GoHighLevel authenticated you and Railway stored the tokens. The problem is Railway is redirecting to the old domain `dir.engageautomations.com` instead of `listings.engageautomations.com`.

## Root Cause

The live Railway deployment has either:
1. Old code with hardcoded `dir.engageautomations.com` URLs
2. Environment variable `GHL_REDIRECT_URI` still set to old domain

## Evidence from Your Test

- OAuth flow completed successfully
- Token exchange worked (timestamp: 1749859005712)
- Installation stored in Railway database
- Redirected to wrong domain causing "Cannot GET /"

## Immediate Fix Required

Deploy updated Railway backend with correct redirect URLs:

### Updated Code Points
- Success URL: `https://listings.engageautomations.com/oauth-success`
- Error URL: `https://listings.engageautomations.com/oauth-error` 
- CORS Origins: Include `listings.engageautomations.com`

### Railway Environment Check
Verify these environment variables in Railway:
- `GHL_REDIRECT_URI` = `listings.engageautomations.com`
- `GHL_CLIENT_ID` = your client ID
- `GHL_CLIENT_SECRET` = your client secret

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated Railway backend code
2. Verify environment variables are correct
3. Test OAuth flow again - should redirect properly to your domain
4. Your existing OAuth installation will work immediately

## Quick Test After Fix

Install again from marketplace - you should land on `https://listings.engageautomations.com/oauth-success` with working "Return to Dashboard" button that takes you to your API management interface.
