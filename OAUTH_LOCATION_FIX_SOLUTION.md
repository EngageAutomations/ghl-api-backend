# OAuth Location ID Fix Solution
**Complete API Integration Fix for GoHighLevel Product Creation**

## Issue Identified
The OAuth installation has valid access tokens but is missing the location ID required for GoHighLevel product creation. This prevents all product API calls from functioning.

## Root Cause
During OAuth callback, the system captures access tokens but doesn't retrieve the user's location ID from GoHighLevel's `/oauth/userinfo` endpoint.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Location ID Retrieval Endpoint
Added `POST /api/fix/location-id` to Railway backend that:
- Uses stored access token to call GoHighLevel's userinfo endpoint
- Extracts location ID and company ID from response
- Updates the installation record with location data
- Retrieves location details (name, business type) for context

### 2. Updated Railway Backend
The complete backend now includes:
- OAuth token capture and storage ✓
- Location ID retrieval and storage ✓
- Product creation API endpoints ✓
- Comprehensive error handling ✓

### 3. API Call Flow
```
Frontend → Railway Backend → GoHighLevel API
          ↗ (OAuth tokens + Location ID stored here)
```

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Fix Location ID
```bash
curl -X POST https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/fix/location-id
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation Update
```bash
curl https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/debug/installations
```

### Step 3: Test Product Creation
```bash
curl -X POST https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/test/ghl-product \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Product", "productType": "DIGITAL"}'
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```json
{
  "ghlLocationId": null,
  "hasAccessToken": true
}
```

### After Fix:
```json
{
  "ghlLocationId": "loc_abc123",
  "ghlLocationName": "User Location",
  "hasAccessToken": true
}
```

### Product Creation Success:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "product": {
    "id": "prod_xyz789",
    "name": "Test Product",
    "locationId": "loc_abc123"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Status
- Railway backend updated with location fix ✓
- Product API endpoints deployed ✓
- OAuth integration complete ✓
- Ready for live testing ✓

This fix resolves the core blocker preventing GoHighLevel API integration from functioning.
