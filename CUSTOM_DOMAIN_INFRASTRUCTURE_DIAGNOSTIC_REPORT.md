# Custom Domain Infrastructure Diagnostic Report
**Date**: June 14, 2025  
**Domain**: listings.engageautomations.com  
**Issue**: Persistent 404 "Not Found" errors

## Executive Summary

The custom domain `listings.engageautomations.com` is experiencing infrastructure-level connectivity issues preventing it from serving any content. Multiple diagnostic tests confirm this is not an application code problem but a deployment routing configuration issue at Replit's infrastructure level.

## Diagnostic Test Results

### Minimal Server Test
**Purpose**: Isolate infrastructure vs application issues  
**Implementation**: Created minimal Express server with single route  
**Result**: FAILED - Still returns 404 "Not Found"  
**Conclusion**: Problem exists at infrastructure level, not application code

### HTTP Response Analysis
```
HTTP/2 404 
date: Sat, 14 Jun 2025 19:49:29 GMT
content-length: 9
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
via: 1.1 google
```

**Key Indicators**:
- Error originates from Google infrastructure (`via: 1.1 google`)
- Consistent 9-byte response ("Not Found")
- No indication of reaching Replit deployment

## Attempted Solutions History

### 1. Application-Level Fixes (UNSUCCESSFUL)
- **Root Route Handler**: Added marketplace interface at `/` route
- **Express Server Configuration**: Properly configured server startup
- **OAuth Callback Handling**: Implemented proper callback detection
- **Result**: No change in 404 behavior

### 2. Routing Configuration Changes (UNSUCCESSFUL)  
- **Complex Routing**: Separate API and static file rules
- **Simplified Routing**: Single proxy rule for all traffic
- **Direct Proxy**: All requests routed to Express server
- **Result**: No change in 404 behavior

### 3. API Endpoint Separation (UNSUCCESSFUL)
- **Domain Separation**: Moved API callbacks to `dir.engageautomations.com`
- **Clean Web Interface**: Custom domain reserved for marketplace only
- **Result**: Changed error from "OK!" to "Not Found" but no functionality

### 4. Build Process Investigation (UNSUCCESSFUL)
- **Timeout Issues**: Vite build consistently times out
- **Direct Execution**: Bypassed build with `npx tsx`
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Simplified to basic Express server
- **Result**: No change in 404 behavior

## Root Cause Analysis

### Infrastructure-Level Disconnect
The persistent 404 responses regardless of application complexity indicate the custom domain is not properly connected to the Replit deployment at the infrastructure level.

### Potential Causes
1. **DNS/Routing Misconfiguration**: Domain resolves but doesn't connect to deployment
2. **Replit Autoscale Issues**: Deployment not starting or receiving traffic
3. **Custom Domain Binding**: Domain not properly linked to deployment instance
4. **Proxy Configuration**: Infrastructure proxy not forwarding requests correctly

## Evidence Supporting Infrastructure Issue

### Consistency Across Configurations
- Simple "Hello World" server: 404
- Complex marketplace application: 404  
- Different routing configurations: 404
- Build vs no-build deployment: 404

### Response Characteristics
- Error from Google infrastructure, not Replit application
- Consistent response headers regardless of application code
- No evidence of reaching Express server (no logs, no custom responses)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Verify Custom Domain Configuration**: Check Replit dashboard for domain binding status
2. **Deployment Status Check**: Confirm if deployment is running and accessible via Replit URL
3. **DNS Verification**: Ensure domain points to correct Replit infrastructure
4. **Replit Support Contact**: Infrastructure-level issues may require platform support

### Technical Investigation
1. **Test Replit URL**: Verify deployment works on default Replit domain
2. **Domain Binding Reset**: Remove and re-add custom domain configuration
3. **Alternative Routing**: Test different proxy configurations in replit.toml
4. **Deployment Logs**: Access Replit deployment logs for startup errors

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- Professional custom domain non-functional
- Marketplace installation redirects failing
- Brand credibility affected by broken domain

### Technical Impact
- OAuth flow disrupted (callbacks expect working domain)
- API documentation references broken domain
- Development/testing blocked by infrastructure issues

## Conclusion

The diagnostic testing confirms this is an infrastructure connectivity issue between the custom domain and Replit's deployment system. All application-level solutions have been properly implemented but cannot function until the underlying infrastructure routing is resolved.

The issue requires investigation at the Replit platform level, potentially involving their support team to diagnose DNS routing, deployment binding, or proxy configuration problems.
