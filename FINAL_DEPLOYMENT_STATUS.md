# Railway-Replit Bridge Integration - DEPLOYMENT READY

## Status: COMPLETE ✓

The Railway-Replit bridge integration is complete and ready for deployment. This solution maintains your existing domain setup while allowing Railway to fetch OAuth credentials from Replit.

## Architecture

**OAuth Flow:**
GoHighLevel → dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback → Railway fetches credentials from Replit → Token exchange → Installation storage → Redirect to listings.engageautomations.com

## Deployment Package

**Location:** `railway-deployment-package/`

**Files:**
- `index.js` - Enhanced Railway backend with bridge integration
- `package.json` - Dependencies (express, cors, node-fetch)
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `README.md` - Setup instructions

## Environment Variables for Railway

```
REPLIT_BRIDGE_URL=https://62a303e9-3e97-4c9f-a7b4-c0026049fd6d-00-30skmv0mqe63e.janeway.replit.dev
BRIDGE_TOKEN=replit-railway-bridge-2025
```

## Bridge Endpoints (Replit)

- `GET /api/oauth-config` - Provides OAuth credentials to Railway
- `POST /api/sync-installation` - Receives installation data from Railway  
- `GET /api/bridge/health` - Health monitoring

## Verified Working

- Bridge server running on port 3001
- OAuth credentials configured in Replit environment
- Security authentication working (Bearer token protection)
- OAuth token exchange tested successfully
- Product creation confirmed (AI Robot Assistant Pro: 685a7095a4e9bb2677405a72)

## Benefits

- Domain continuity maintained (dir.engageautomations.com)
- OAuth credentials securely managed in Replit
- Automatic installation sync between Railway and Replit
- Fallback support if bridge temporarily unavailable

## Next Step

Upload the files in `railway-deployment-package/` to your Railway project and set the environment variables. The bridge will automatically handle OAuth credential fetching during marketplace installations.

The integration preserves your existing infrastructure while adding secure credential management through Replit.
