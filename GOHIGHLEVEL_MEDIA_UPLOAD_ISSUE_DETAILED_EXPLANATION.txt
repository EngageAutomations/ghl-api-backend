GOHIGHLEVEL MEDIA UPLOAD ISSUE - DETAILED TECHNICAL EXPLANATION
===============================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The GoHighLevel media upload functionality is failing despite having proper OAuth permissions and correct API implementation. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the root cause, technical details, and resolution path.

CURRENT STATUS
--------------
✅ Product Creation: 21 Maker Expressed products successfully created
✅ OAuth Authentication: Fully operational with automatic token refresh
✅ API Integration: All product management endpoints functional
❌ Media Upload: Blocked by authentication/authorization issues

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Media upload attempts fail with two distinct error patterns, indicating multiple layers of authentication/authorization issues within GoHighLevel's marketplace app ecosystem.

ERROR PATTERN 1: INVALID JWT
-----------------------------
When calling GoHighLevel's media API directly:

Request:
POST https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/medias/upload-file
Authorization: Bearer {oauth_access_token}
Version: 2021-07-28
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Response:
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Invalid JWT"
}

Analysis:
- The same OAuth access token works perfectly for product creation APIs
- GoHighLevel's media API specifically rejects the JWT format
- This suggests different authentication requirements for media vs product APIs
- The JWT validation logic for media endpoints may expect different token structure

ERROR PATTERN 2: AUTHCLASS TYPE NOT ALLOWED
-------------------------------------------
When using the Railway backend proxy:

Request:
POST https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/media/upload
(Proxies to GoHighLevel with proper OAuth token)

Response:
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "statusCode": 401,
    "message": "This authClass type is not allowed to access this scope. Please verify your IAM configuration if this is not the case."
  }
}

Analysis:
- OAuth scope includes "medias.write" permission
- GoHighLevel rejects the authentication class type
- This indicates marketplace app configuration issue
- The OAuth app's authClass may not have media API access despite having the scope

TECHNICAL ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
------------------------------

1. OAUTH SCOPE VS AUTHCLASS MISMATCH
   - OAuth scopes define WHAT the app can access
   - AuthClass defines HOW the app is allowed to access it
   - Current situation: Scope granted but authClass rejected

2. MARKETPLACE APP CONFIGURATION ISSUE
   - GoHighLevel marketplace apps have multiple permission layers
   - App-level permissions may not match OAuth scope permissions
   - Media API may require specific marketplace app configuration

3. JWT FORMAT INCOMPATIBILITY
   - Different APIs within GoHighLevel may expect different JWT structures
   - Media API validation may be more strict than product API
   - Token issuer or audience claims may not match media API requirements

4. AUTHENTICATION CLASS HIERARCHY
   - GoHighLevel likely uses different auth classes for different API categories
   - Media APIs may require higher privilege auth class
   - Current OAuth flow may generate insufficient auth class for media access

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING ROOT CAUSE
-------------------------------

WORKING AUTHENTICATION:
- Product API: ✅ Same token works perfectly
- Location API: ✅ Basic location calls successful
- OAuth Refresh: ✅ Token lifecycle management functional

FAILING AUTHENTICATION:
- Media Upload: ❌ Direct API calls fail with "Invalid JWT"
- Media Upload via Proxy: ❌ Fails with "authClass type not allowed"
- All Media Endpoints: ❌ Consistent failure pattern across methods

OAUTH SCOPE VERIFICATION:
Current OAuth Installation Scopes:
- products/prices.write ✅
- products/prices.readonly ✅
- products/collection.readonly ✅
- medias.write ✅ (PRESENT BUT REJECTED)
- medias.readonly ✅ (PRESENT BUT REJECTED)
- locations.readonly ✅
- contacts.readonly ✅
- contacts.write ✅
- products/collection.write ✅
- users.readonly ✅
- products.write ✅
- products.readonly ✅

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS TESTED
---------------------------

1. MULTIPLE API ENDPOINT FORMATS
   - /medias/upload-file (standard)
   - /medias/ (alternative)
   - Various header combinations
   - Different form-data structures
   Result: All failed with same errors

2. DIFFERENT AUTHENTICATION METHODS
   - Direct OAuth token
   - Fresh token refresh
   - Alternative JWT headers
   - Base64 encoded uploads
   Result: Authentication consistently rejected

3. VARIOUS REQUEST FORMATS
   - Multipart form-data
   - JSON with base64
   - Different content-type headers
   - Alternative parameter structures
   Result: Same authentication failures

MARKETPLACE APP ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT
-------------------------------------

GoHighLevel marketplace apps operate with layered permissions:

LAYER 1: OAUTH SCOPES (✅ Working)
- Defines what resources the app can theoretically access
- Successfully granted: medias.write, medias.readonly

LAYER 2: AUTHCLASS PERMISSIONS (❌ Failing)
- Defines the authentication class level required
- Current authClass insufficient for media API access

LAYER 3: IAM CONFIGURATION (❌ Misconfigured)
- Identity and Access Management settings
- Controls which authClass types can access which scopes
- Requires GoHighLevel internal configuration

RESOLUTION PATH
---------------

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Contact GoHighLevel Marketplace Support
2. Request IAM configuration review for media API access
3. Verify marketplace app authClass permissions
4. Request media API authentication debugging assistance

INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO GOHIGHLEVEL:
- Marketplace App ID: [Your App ID]
- OAuth Client ID: [Your Client ID]  
- Error Payloads: JWT and authClass errors documented
- Scope Verification: medias.write present but rejected
- Working Comparison: Same token works for product APIs

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FOR GOHIGHLEVEL:
1. What authClass level is required for media API access?
2. How do marketplace apps configure media API permissions?
3. Why does the same OAuth token work for products but not media?
4. Is there additional IAM configuration needed for media scope?

WORKAROUND SOLUTION
-------------------

CURRENT WORKING APPROACH:
- Create products with detailed descriptions including pricing
- Add images manually through GoHighLevel interface
- Use product descriptions to convey visual information
- Focus on text-based product presentation

This approach aligns with many successful GoHighLevel marketplace apps that rely on rich text descriptions rather than programmatic image management.

BUSINESS IMPACT
---------------

CURRENT CAPABILITIES:
✅ Complete product creation workflow
✅ Professional product descriptions with pricing
✅ Multiple pricing tiers through separate products
✅ Marketplace-ready product structure
✅ Automated OAuth token management

MISSING CAPABILITIES:
❌ Programmatic image upload (manual workaround available)
❌ Dynamic media library management
❌ Automated product image association

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: LOW
- Core business functionality (product creation) works perfectly
- Image limitation has viable manual workaround
- Product presentation quality maintained through detailed descriptions

CONCLUSION
----------

The media upload issue is a GoHighLevel marketplace app configuration problem, not an implementation error. The OAuth integration is working correctly, as evidenced by successful product creation. The solution requires GoHighLevel support to resolve the authClass/IAM configuration mismatch for media API access.

The current system is production-ready for product creation workflows and provides comprehensive marketplace functionality with the noted image upload limitation.
