# Complete Railway OAuth Deployment Guide

## Current Issue
Railway cannot access the environment variables, causing OAuth callbacks to fail with 401 errors.

## Solution: Multiple Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway Environment Variable Fix

**Step 1: Verify Railway Variables**
In Railway dashboard → Variables tab, ensure these exact names:
```
GHL_CLIENT_ID = 68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4
GHL_CLIENT_SECRET = b5a7a120-7df7-4d23-8796-4863cbd08f94
```

**Step 2: Deploy Files**
Copy these files to your GitHub repository:

1. **index.js** (from `railway-deployment-package/`)
2. **package.json** 
3. **railway.json**

**Step 3: Force Railway Redeploy**
- Push to GitHub
- In Railway dashboard → Deployments → Trigger Deploy

### Option 2: Alternative Hosting (Recommended)

Since Railway has persistent environment variable issues, deploy to Vercel:

**Vercel Deployment:**
1. Create new project on Vercel
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically

**Update GoHighLevel Redirect URI:**
Change from: `https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback`
To: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/oauth/callback`

### Option 3: Heroku Deployment

```bash
# Create Heroku app
heroku create your-oauth-backend

# Set environment variables
heroku config:set GHL_CLIENT_ID=68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4
heroku config:set GHL_CLIENT_SECRET=b5a7a120-7df7-4d23-8796-4863cbd08f94

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

## Files Ready for Deployment

All deployment files are in `railway-deployment-package/`:
- `index.js` - Secure OAuth backend
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

## Testing After Deployment

```bash
# Health check should show version 3.0
curl "https://your-deployment-url/health"

# Environment check should show secrets available
curl "https://your-deployment-url/api/env-check"
```

## Security Features
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Environment variable validation
- Graceful error handling
- Secure logging (no secret exposure)

The secure OAuth backend will work on any platform that properly handles environment variables.
