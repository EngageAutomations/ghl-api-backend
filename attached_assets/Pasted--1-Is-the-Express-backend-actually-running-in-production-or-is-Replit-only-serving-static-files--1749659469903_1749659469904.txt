âœ… 1. Is the Express backend actually running in production â€” or is Replit only serving static files?
If not running your Node server, the OAuth callback will never work, no matter what your route code looks like.

Are you sure the Replit "Run" button starts node server/index.js?

Does the Replit console show something like: âœ… Server running on port 3000?

What does the .replit file run and deployment.run sections say?

âœ… 2. Is the backend GET /api/oauth/callback route defined at the top of the server â€” before static middleware or frontend routing?
Express matches routes in order. If your frontend catch-all comes first, it overrides everything else.

Where is the callback route defined relative to your app.use('*', ...) or app.use(express.static(...)) lines?

Have you tried putting a console.log('HIT CALLBACK') at the very top of server/index.ts?

Does it ever appear?

âœ… 3. When visiting the callback URL with a fake code, do you see ANY server log?
bash
Copy
Edit
https://yourdomain.com/api/oauth/callback?code=test
This tells us if your backend is even receiving the request.

What log (if any) shows up in the Replit console?

What status code do you get in the browser?

Does it redirect to /oauth-error without even logging the error?

âœ… 4. Are there any TypeScript build errors in the Replit console?
A bad import, const redeclaration, or typing conflict can kill your entire backend without crashing visibly.

Do you see messages like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'handleOAuthCallback' before initialization
or

arduino
Copy
Edit
Unexpected token export
Is your server/index.ts or routes.ts compiling cleanly?

âœ… 5. What happens when you make a manual cURL call to the callback route?
bash
Copy
Edit
curl "https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback?code=test123"
If this returns HTML, you're hitting the frontend instead of backend.

What does the response body say?

Whatâ€™s the status code? (200, 404, 302?)

Does it look like a React/Vite HTML page?

ðŸ§ª Bonus: Smoke Test Snippet
Hereâ€™s something to test your backend routing in the simplest possible form:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
  console.log('âœ… /test route hit');
  res.send('Server test route is working!');
});
Try visiting:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://dir.engageautomations.com/test
If you don't see logs or output â€” you're not running the backend at all.
