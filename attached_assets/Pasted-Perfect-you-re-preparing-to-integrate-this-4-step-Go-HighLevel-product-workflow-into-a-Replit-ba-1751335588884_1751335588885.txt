Perfect — you're preparing to integrate this 4-step Go HighLevel product workflow into a **Replit-based project**, so here’s a checklist of **key questions to send to Replit or clarify internally** to ensure smooth implementation.

---

## ❓ Questions to Ask or Investigate in Replit Context

### 🔐 **1. OAuth Token Handling**

* How are we managing the Go HighLevel OAuth access token?

  * Do we already have a refresh mechanism in place?
  * Where are tokens stored securely (Replit Secrets, DB, or local memory)?

### 🗃️ **2. File Upload Support**

* Can we upload images from Replit to Go HighLevel?

  * Are we uploading **local files**, or do we need to support **file uploads from a user interface (via form input)?**
  * If UI upload: Are we using `express` or some framework that supports `multipart/form-data`?

### 🧰 **3. Required Node.js Packages**

* Do we have the following modules installed in Replit?

  * `axios`
  * `form-data`
  * `fs` (comes with Node, but confirm access to file system)
* Do we need to install or update these via Replit's package manager?

### 🛠️ **4. Runtime Environment**

* Are we using plain Node.js or a framework like `Express`?

  * If Express: Do we already have endpoints where this workflow will be triggered?
* Is the app running persistently, or do we need to handle cold starts or persistence issues (e.g., with OAuth tokens)?

### 🧪 **5. Testing and Logging**

* How do we want to test this?

  * Manual test with test image?
  * Auto-test with a dummy product and mock image?
* Where should logs go: console only, or Replit's built-in debugger?

### 💾 **6. Data Inputs**

* Where will the inputs for product name, description, price, and image file path come from?

  * Static for now?
  * From a form submission?
  * From an external webhook?

### 🖼️ **7. Multiple Images or Just One?**

* Do we want to support only one image per product right now?

  * If multiple: How do we store/display them (e.g., as custom fields or external gallery)?

### 📤 Message to Replit Team or Dev Partner

> Hey, we're implementing a 4-step Go HighLevel product creation flow:
>
> 1. Upload product image
> 2. Create product
> 3. Update product with image URL
> 4. Add price to product
>
> Can you help clarify:
>
> * How are we handling and storing the OAuth token?
> * Do we support file uploads (local or via form) in our current Replit setup?
> * Are `axios`, `form-data`, and `fs` available or do we need to install them?
> * Are we using Express or plain Node? Where will we trigger this flow from?
> * What's our plan for logging and testing this?
> * Where are the product/image inputs coming from (manual or form)?
> * Do we support only one image per product right now?

Once you hear back, I can help you implement based on their answers. Want help drafting a sample Replit endpoint or script to trigger the full flow now?
