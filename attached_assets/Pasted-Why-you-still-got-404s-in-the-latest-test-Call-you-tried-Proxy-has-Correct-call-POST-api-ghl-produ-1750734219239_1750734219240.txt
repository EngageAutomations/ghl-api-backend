Why you still got 404s in the latest test
Call you tried	Proxy has?	Correct call
POST /api/ghl/products/create	Yes (legacy)	Needs body param installation_id
POST /api/ghl/products	No	Use POST /api/ghl/locations/:locationId/products
POST /api/ghl/locations/:locationId/products	Yes	Must be POST with JSON body; the 404 you saw means the request probably reached Railway as GET (e.g., form action default) or had a path/typo.
POST /api/ghl/locations/:locationId/media	Yes	Must be multipart/form-data with field key file; again, 404 shows it hit the proxy as a different verb or wrong URL.
GET /api/installations	No	Not implemented; use / (root) to see a count or add this route if you need it.

Tip: watch the Railway Deploy → Logs panel; every matching route logs a line ([POST] /api/ghl/locations/...) so you’ll know instantly whether the proxy actually received the verb + path you expect.

Checklist to eliminate the 404s
Double-check the exact fetch/axios path in Replit:

js
Copy
Edit
await api.post(`/api/ghl/locations/${locationId}/products`, body);
Ensure it’s really a POST:
An HTML <form> defaults to GET — React Query / Axios default to POST.

If you still need a list endpoint add quickly:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get('/api/installations', (_,res)=>res.json([...installations.values()]));
Legacy “/products/create” still works but requires installation_id in body/query.

No further package.json changes
The runtime dependencies in your original 1.2.1 manifest are still sufficient; the added code only re-uses express, axios, multer, and form-data.

Action for the Replit agent
Switch all new flows to the location-centric paths (/api/ghl/locations/:locationId/...).

Send POST for both media and products.

Pass JWT in Authorization header (unchanged).

Remove any residual calls to /api/ghl/products or /api/ghl/products/create unless you still support the old UI.

Once those URL adjustments are in place, the proxy will return 200 instead of 404 and your products/media will appear in GoHighLevel.
