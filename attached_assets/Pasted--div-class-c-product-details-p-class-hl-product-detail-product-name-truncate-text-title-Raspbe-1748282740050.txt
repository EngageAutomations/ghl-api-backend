Unfortunately these can not not be accessed as easy as intended.</p><p>The used keyboard is the cheapest I’ve found on amazon and does its job.</p><p>The kits panels are separated into multiple parts, because my 3D printer has a relatively small bed.</p><p>This is the reason, why there are so many screws.</p><p>The little bumps on the front-panel in the top left and right corners are cases for magnets which should hold together the keyboard-cover and the frontpanel. But this system is also not as good as I expected it to be, which is why in addition the panels are secured with zip ties.</p><p></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4320648">RaspberryPERK (Pi Emergency and Recovery Kit) by Philipp1887 - Thingiverse</a></p></div><div class="show-more">Show More</div></div>
