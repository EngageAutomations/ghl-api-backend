Great breakdown ‚Äî you've clearly analyzed GoHighLevel's product form structure in detail. Let‚Äôs now synthesize everything into a clean structure you can use to replicate in your form or directory. I‚Äôll outline both **pricing** and **variants**, showing how the fields expand based on user interaction and what you'd want to include in your form logic/UI.

---

### üì¶ **1. Pricing Section Structure**

**Default Fields (Always Visible):**

* **Type** (dropdown): One-time / Recurring
* **Amount** (currency input)

**Optional Field (Always Visible):**

* **Compare at Price** (currency input)

**Conditional Fields (If "Recurring" is selected):**

* **Billing Period** (dropdown): Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly
* **Trial Period** (number input): Days
* **Number of Payments** (number input)
* **Setup Fee** (currency input)

**Implementation Suggestions:**

* Use conditional rendering: show additional fields only when ‚ÄúRecurring‚Äù is selected.
* Group all "Recurring"-only fields in one collapsible container or card for clarity.
* Use client-side validation for number formats and limits.

### üé® **2. Variants Section Structure**

**Initial UI:**

* **Button**: ‚ÄúAdd Variant‚Äù

**When clicked:**

* **Option Name** (text input): e.g., *Size*
* **Option Values** (text inputs):

  * Auto-extend: When the user types in one value, the next field appears.
  * Consider capping at **10 values** to prevent overflows.
  * Add a **‚ÄúDone‚Äù** button to finalize this variant.

**Post-Done UI:**

* Shows a row labeled with the **Option Name** (e.g., Size) and the chosen values (e.g., Black, White, Blue)
* A button: ‚ÄúAdd Another Variant‚Äù

**Inventory Controls (Optional but Powerful):**

* **Track Inventory** (checkbox/radio)

  * If selected:

    * **Continue Selling When Out of Stock** (checkbox)

**Variants Table:**

* A dynamic table that generates **all possible combinations** of the variant options
* Columns:

  1. **Variant** (e.g., Size: Black)
  2. **Price**
  3. **Compare at Price**
  4. **Available Quantity**
  5. **Delete Option** (X button)

**Implementation Suggestions:**

* Use combinatorial logic to generate all possible variant permutations when multiple variant groups exist.
* Let users delete specific permutations (e.g., Blue Large doesn't exist).
* Sync inventory fields dynamically with any changes in variant combinations.

### ‚úÖ Final Thoughts and Dev Suggestions:

* Keep your **form state modular**, especially for variants.
* Use **React state or similar frameworks** to handle the dynamic form behavior efficiently (like auto-expanding fields).
* Ensure **accessibility** (labels, ARIA, tab ordering).
* Consider a **step-by-step form wizard** for longer forms to reduce overwhelm.
* Later, if you do revisit variants, consider **bulk import/export** or **CSV upload** for high-volume stores.

Would you like a wireframe-style diagram or JSON schema to represent this setup for prototyping or dev purposes?
