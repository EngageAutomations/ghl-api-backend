üß≠ GOAL
Create a product (directory listing, item, etc.) in a user's GoHighLevel sub-account using a valid OAuth access token.

‚úÖ PREREQUISITES
You need:
‚úÖ OAuth access token

‚úÖ GoHighLevel locationId (from token response or stored)

‚úÖ products.write scope included in your OAuth request

‚úÖ A backend route to send the API call securely

üì§ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
üîê Step 1: Make sure you have the access token
From the OAuth exchange flow:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "access_token": "abc123",
  "refresh_token": "def456",
  "locationId": "abc_location_789"
}
‚úçÔ∏è Step 2: Create the product payload
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "locationId": "abc_location_789",
  "name": "Premium Property Listing",
  "description": "Gorgeous 3-bedroom home with modern updates.",
  "imageUrl": "https://cdn.leadconnectorhq.com/media/property-abc.jpg",
  "price": "350000"
}
You can also omit price if you‚Äôre handling pricing with a separate price object.

üì° Step 3: Send the request to HighLevel
http
Copy
Edit
POST https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/products/
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
Example in Node.js using Axios:
ts
Copy
Edit
import axios from 'axios';

async function createProduct({ accessToken, locationId, product }) {
  const payload = {
    locationId,
    name: product.name,
    description: product.description,
    imageUrl: product.imageUrl,
    price: product.price
  };

  const res = await axios.post(
    'https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/products/',
    payload,
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }
  );

  return res.data;
}
üì• Step 4: Example response
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "product_abc123",
  "name": "Premium Property Listing",
  "imageUrl": "https://cdn.leadconnectorhq.com/media/property-abc.jpg",
  "locationId": "abc_location_789",
  "price": "350000",
  ...
}
‚úÖ Use the returned product.id to:

Update product info later

Add pricing separately

Include/exclude it from the store

üß† TIPS
Task	Tip
Access token expires	Use refresh_token to get a new one
Need to attach file first?	Upload with /media/, use returned url
Dynamic pricing	Use POST /products/prices/ after creating product
Image not showing?	Confirm media is in HighLevel‚Äôs library and URL is valid

‚úÖ Final Checklist
 OAuth scopes include products.write

 Access token is valid (not expired)

 Payload includes locationId and name

 Content-Type is application/json

 Bearer token in header
