Perfect — this means **your redirect URL is finally working**, but now you're hitting a **404 error on the frontend**. Let’s quickly break it down:

---

## ❌ What's Happening

Your browser was redirected to:

```
https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth/callback
```

But instead of hitting a **backend route** (like an API handler), the request went to your **frontend router** (likely React/Next.js/Vite/SPA), which doesn't recognize `/oauth/callback` as a route.

Hence:

> “404 Page Not Found – Did you forget to add the page to the router?”

---

## ✅ What You Meant to Do

You want the OAuth `code` to be handled **by your backend**, not rendered as a page.

---

## 🛠️ How to Fix It

### ✅ Option 1: Handle `/oauth/callback` in Your **Backend Server**

Make sure your backend (e.g., Express or Fastify) has this route:

```ts
app.get('/oauth/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code } = req.query;
  if (!code) return res.status(400).send('Missing code');

  // Exchange code for tokens...
  // Store tokens in DB...
  // Redirect user to frontend (dashboard, wizard, etc)
  return res.redirect('/dashboard');
});
```

> 🔁 **The frontend should never need to render `/oauth/callback`**. It’s just a redirect handler.

### ✅ Option 2: Add a Route in Frontend (Not Recommended)

Only do this if you're handling OAuth in the frontend — which is not recommended for GoHighLevel because:

* You need to keep `client_secret` secure
* Token exchange must be server-side

---

### ✅ Best Practice: Use a Hidden Backend Route

1. Set your redirect URI to point to your backend:

   ```
   https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback
   ```

2. In backend (e.g. `server/routes.ts`):

   ```ts
   router.get('/api/oauth/callback', oauthCallbackHandler);
   ```

3. After token exchange, redirect the user:

   ```ts
   res.redirect('/dashboard'); // or /wizard
   ```

---

## ✅ Next Steps

* [ ] Confirm that your backend (Replit or deployed server) has a **`GET /oauth/callback`** route
* [ ] Ensure **your domain routes requests to it**, not the frontend
* [ ] Avoid registering `/oauth/callback` as a frontend page unless it's only for displaying a loading spinner briefly

Would you like me to give you the full `oauth/callback` backend handler in Node.js?
