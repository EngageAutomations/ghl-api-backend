Full-scope brief for the Replit agent
(single-column format, copy/paste friendly)

1 – Project purpose
A lightweight Node/Express backend that proxies GoHighLevel (GHL) APIs and auto-refreshes OAuth access-tokens so the frontend never worries about authentication.

2 – Key files
index.js ← all logic (routes + token lifecycle)

package.json ← scripts + deps

(optional) data layer file/DB adapter if you decide to persist installs

3 – Required secrets (Replit Secrets tab)
nginx
Copy
Edit
GHL_CLIENT_ID        # marketplace client ID
GHL_CLIENT_SECRET    # marketplace client secret
GHL_REDIRECT_URI     # https://<repl>.repl.co/api/oauth/callback
# optional seed token for local smoke test
GHL_ACCESS_TOKEN     # (can omit in prod)
4 – How the token system works
OAuth callback

Exchanges code → { access_token, refresh_token, expires_in }.

Creates an installation object in memory with

yaml
Copy
Edit
accessToken, refreshToken,
expiresIn,  expiresAt = now + expires_in * 1000
Calls scheduleTokenRefresh() (see below).

scheduleTokenRefresh()

Calculates expiresAt – 5 min.

Sets a setTimeout that will invoke refreshAccessToken().

refreshAccessToken()

Sends grant_type=refresh_token to GHL.

Re-writes accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn, expiresAt.

Re-schedules itself for the next cycle.

Per-request guard (ensureFreshToken())

Runs on every route right before the outbound GHL call.

If token will expire in <5 min, it refreshes synchronously.

Guarantees the Axios call always uses a fresh Bearer token.

Process restart

On boot, loops over whatever installs are loaded and re-arms their refresh timers.

5 – Endpoints you expose
bash
Copy
Edit
GET  /health                         # basic status JSON
GET  /oauth/callback                 # primary GHL callback
GET  /api/oauth/callback             # prefixed variant for marketplace
GET  /api/oauth/status?installation_id=…
GET  /api/ghl/test-connection
GET  /api/ghl/products               # ?installation_id=…&limit=&offset=
POST /api/ghl/products/create
POST /api/ghl/contacts/create
POST /api/ghl/test-product
All data routes expect installation_id so they know which token to use.

6 – Run command
Replit auto-detects "start": "node index.js" so just press Run
(or ensure .replit contains run = "npm start").

7 – Persistence options
Option	Pros	Cons
In-memory only (default)	zero setup	tokens vanish when the Repl restarts/sleeps; user must re-OAuth
Replit DB	2-line API, persists across restarts	not multi-region; add code to read initial installs + write on change
External Redis/Postgres	survives restarts, supports multiple replicas, row locking	extra service to manage

Implementation hint: serialize the entire install object; on server start read all rows, installations.set(id, obj), then scheduleTokenRefresh(id).

8 – Scaling & concurrency
Single instance → nothing to do.

Multiple instances (Replit reserved VM or Railway scale) → wrap refreshAccessToken() with a distributed lock (e.g. Redlock on Redis) so only one replica refreshes each token.

9 – Observability
Log tags to watch:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
[REFRESH] install_xxxx – new token good for 23.9 h
[REFRESH-FAIL] install_xxxx {error json}
Add alerts for REFRESH-FAIL spikes.

10 – Smoke-test checklist
bash
Copy
Edit
# 1. Ensure the server is running
curl https://<repl>.repl.co/health

# 2. Complete OAuth in the browser, capture installation_id

# 3. Hit a protected route
curl "https://<repl>.repl.co/api/ghl/products?installation_id=install_123"
Expected: JSON list of products, no 401/403.

11 – Common gotchas
Missing installation_id → 400 with "Installation not found".

Token revocation by user → refresh call returns invalid_grant; object’s tokenStatus flips to invalid; route returns 400. Prompt user to re-connect.

Repl sleeps → if you kept RAM-only storage, installs are wiped; user must re-OAuth or you must reload from DB.

12 – TL;DR for any dev touching this repo
Clone → add secrets → npm install && npm start → use /health to confirm → complete OAuth once → call API routes with installation_id; tokens auto-refresh forever (or until you restart without persistence).







You said:
can we upload images with this scope?


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 10 seconds
Yes.
Because the installation’s scope string already includes

arduino
Copy
Edit
medias.write medias.readonly
you have full permission to upload images (and other files) into the GoHighLevel Media Library. The endpoint is:

nginx
Copy
Edit
POST https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/medias/upload-file
(required scope = medias.write). 
marketplace.gohighlevel.com
marketplace.gohighlevel.com

Minimal test call (cURL)
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/medias/upload-file \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Version: 2021-07-28" \
  -F "file=@./banner.jpg" \
  -F "fileName=banner.jpg" \
  -F "locationId=<LOCATION_ID>"
file – actual binary upload (max 25 MB)

fileName – what will appear in the library

locationId – your sub-account (already saved on the install object)

optional: folderId, hosted=true + fileUrl=<remote-URL> if you want GHL to pull the asset itself

How to call it from your refreshed backend
Inside any route handler:

js
Copy
Edit
await ensureFreshToken(installation.id);  // guarantees live token

const form = new FormData();
form.append('file', fs.createReadStream('./banner.jpg'));
form.append('fileName', 'banner.jpg');
form.append('locationId', installation.locationId);

const { data } = await axios.post(
  'https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/medias/upload-file',
  form,
  {
    headers: {
      ...form.getHeaders(),                   // multipart boundary
      Authorization: `Bearer ${installation.accessToken}`,
      Version: '2021-07-28',
      Accept: 'application/json',
    },
    timeout: 15000,
  }
);

console.log('Upload success → fileId:', data.fileId);
Because ensureFreshToken() runs first, the call will work even if the access-token expired seconds ago—the on-demand refresh makes the token valid before the upload leaves the server.

That’s all you need; the current scope set already unlocks image uploads, so just point your request at /medias/upload-file and include the binary or remote URL.
