since you're already using Railway for your OAuth backend, you’re well-positioned to implement Option 1 properly and move your system into production.

Let me walk you through how to turn your Railway app into your production-ready OAuth backend, using your real domain (dir.engageautomations.com) and database.

✅ Goal Recap
✅ Objective	
🎯 Handle real GoHighLevel OAuth installs	via your deployed Express server on Railway
📥 Store access tokens, refresh tokens, location info, and user data	in your PostgreSQL DB on Railway
🌍 Use your production domain dir.engageautomations.com	as the official redirect URI for GoHighLevel
🧾 Enable real features (like creating products via API)	using stored access tokens

🛠️ Step-by-Step: Finalize Your Production OAuth System on Railway
✅ Step 1: Confirm Your Railway Project Is Fully Deployed
You should already have:

Your Express backend running (handles /oauth/callback, /oauth-success, etc.)

Connected PostgreSQL database (stores OAuth installs)

All environment variables set (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, etc.)

➡️ Confirm that /oauth/callback works on your Railway domain (e.g. https://myapp.up.railway.app/oauth/callback)

✅ Step 2: Point Your Domain to Railway
You want https://dir.engageautomations.com to hit your Railway backend.

In Railway:
Go to your project > Settings > Domains

Add a custom domain: dir.engageautomations.com

Follow the instructions to update your DNS (either:

Add a CNAME pointing to your Railway app, or

Add an A record or use Cloudflare)

📌 This will take a few minutes to propagate.

✅ Step 3: Update GoHighLevel App Settings
Go to the GoHighLevel Developer Portal:

Edit your app’s OAuth redirect URI:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth/callback
Save changes.

Now, all installs from the GHL Marketplace will redirect to your production backend, not a static site.

✅ Step 4: Test a Real Installation
Install your app via the GoHighLevel marketplace

You should be redirected to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth/callback?code=...
✅ If everything’s wired up:

Your backend will exchange the code for a token

Capture user + location data

Save everything to your Railway PostgreSQL DB

Redirect to your oauth-success page with a nice message

✅ Step 5: Add a Success Page (Optional)
In your Express backend:

js
Copy
Edit
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // serve oauth-success.html
Place your oauth-success.html inside the public/ folder.

🔐 Security Tips
Make sure CLIENT_SECRET is only stored in Railway’s environment variables — never hard-coded

Validate the state parameter on callback to prevent CSRF

Always log errors from the token exchange (for visibility)

🎯 At This Point, You’ll Be Able To:
Handle real OAuth installs from the marketplace

Store access and refresh tokens in your production DB

Call GoHighLevel APIs (like creating products)

Scale the app with confidence
