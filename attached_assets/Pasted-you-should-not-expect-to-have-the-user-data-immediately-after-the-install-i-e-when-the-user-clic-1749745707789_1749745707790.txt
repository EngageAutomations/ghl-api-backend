you should *not expect to have the user data immediately after the install (i.e., when the user clicks "Install" or completes the OAuth flow) unless you explicitly complete the token exchange yourself using the code GoHighLevel returns.

🔍 What the Transcript Confirms:
From the video transcript, the GoHighLevel OAuth 2.0 flow works exactly like a standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant. That means:

User installs the app and is redirected to your app with an authorization code in the URL.

YOU must then exchange that code (along with your client ID, client secret, redirect URI, and user type) at GoHighLevel’s token endpoint (https://leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/token) to get:

access_token

refresh_token

location_id

Granted scopes

Then, and only then, can you use the access_token to fetch user data from the GoHighLevel API (e.g., contacts, user profile, locations, etc.).

🔁 This flow is not automatic — GoHighLevel does not send you user data on the redirect. You must do the token exchange manually and use the access token to retrieve what you need.

🧠 Your Likely Misconception:
You might have assumed that once the user is redirected to your oauth-success page (with the code in the query string), GoHighLevel would’ve already given you all the account data.

But in OAuth 2.0, the code is just a temporary key — you don’t get any real data until you exchange it.

✅ What You Should Be Doing (Right After OAuth Redirect):
In your backend:

Detect the code in the request (req.query.code)

Make a POST request to https://leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/token with:

client_id

client_secret

grant_type=authorization_code

code (from the query)

user_type (likely "location")

redirect_uri (must match exactly)

On success:

Capture the access_token, refresh_token, location_id, etc.

Use the access_token to query GoHighLevel APIs for user details

Store this info in your database

🔧 If You’re Not Seeing User Data in Your DB:
Then likely:

You're not making the token exchange (or it’s failing)

You’re not using the access token to query user info

Or you're not saving the results after successful queries
