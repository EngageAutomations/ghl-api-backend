 still seeing the 404, something isn’t quite connecting in production despite the routing fix being claimed deployed.

Here’s how to proceed surgically to isolate the issue.

🧠 Final Diagnostic Checklist
Let’s systematically confirm each point to eliminate assumptions.

✅ 1. Confirm the Route Is Truly Active in Production
Test this directly in your browser or via curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -i https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback?code=TESTCODE
You should see:

200 OK or at least some kind of custom backend response

Not a 404 Not Found or default Vite/React HTML

If it's still 404, then:

The route is not actually registered in the deployed server OR

Something upstream (like Vercel, Netlify, or a proxy) is handling the request before it hits the backend

✅ 2. Check for Static Hosting Conflicts
If you're deploying to:

Vercel

Netlify

Cloudflare Pages

Then unless you’ve configured serverless functions correctly or proxy routing, your server routes will never be reached.

Ask: “How is our backend deployed — is it behind a frontend host like Vercel or Replit’s webview?”

✅ 3. Inspect Build Logs or Runtime Logs
Ask your Replit agent:

“Can you confirm the /api/oauth/callback route shows up in the Express app when the server starts?”

For example, log this:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log('OAuth callback route registered at /api/oauth/callback');
✅ 4. Force the Route to Prove It Works
Modify the route just to test, like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.get('/api/oauth/callback', (req, res) => {
  console.log('✅ OAuth callback hit');
  return res.send('✅ OAuth callback route is working.');
});
Then reload:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback?code=123
If you still see a 404 — the route is never reached. Period.

✅ 5. Ensure redirect_uri and Server Code Match
Your redirect_uri in the Marketplace settings is now:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback
Make sure in your code, you’re also using:

ts
Copy
Edit
redirect_uri: 'https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback'
They must match exactly or HighLevel won’t call the right one.
