Directory Wizard Test Summary: Run 1 (Action Button: Download)
1. Directory Info Page
Success: Able to input directory name.

Issue: Logo upload triggers file browser, but:

No UI confirmation or preview of saved logo.

Needs feedback state (e.g., thumbnail preview or success indicator).

2. Opt-In Selection: Action Button vs. Embedded Form
Success: Mutually exclusive selection logic works properly.

Success: All three Action Button types (popup, URL, download) update button preview properly.

Issue (Embedded Form):

Incorrect Form Fields Shown: Should not display form field configuration. All embedded form behavior is handled via iframe, not custom field mapping.

3. Listing Components Configuration
Success: UI toggles function correctly.

Success: Component toggling behaves as expected.

Metadata Field Issues:

Starts with two fields by default – should only start with one.

Cannot delete fields – delete capability needed.

Cannot add fields – add button is unresponsive.

Icon upload is broken – no file browser triggered.

4. Code Generation
Issue:

Default CSS code is inserted correctly.

Missing Action Button code in the CSS block.

Footer/Header code incorrectly injected even though no components require it.

Logic must check if user’s config actually selected components requiring header/footer before generating those code blocks.

5. Generated Form Output
Issue: Missing expected fields based on config.

Selected: Download Button + Price toggle

Got: name, category, description

Missing:

download link

price

short description (for summary)

detailed description

Additional Suggestion:

Consider AI summarizer for creating bullet-point summaries from detailed description.

Naming Convention:

All listings should use the term “Listing Name” (not “Business Name” or other inferred labels).

Classification of listing types is not required per field; standardize on “Listing Name”.

6. Suggested Fixes / Next Steps
UI Adjustments
 Add logo preview or confirmation upon upload

 Fix metadata field behavior:

Add/delete functionality

Icon upload support

 Remove field config from Embedded Form option

Form Builder Logic
 Match generated form fields exactly to user-selected components

 Use a config-driven JSON (or state object) to drive form generation

 Always include: Listing Name, Category, Short Description, Detailed Description

 Conditionally include: Price, Download URL, Address, Popup URL, metadata fields (1–5)

Code Output Fixes
 Ensure Action Button CSS is inserted based on the chosen type

 Suppress footer/header code unless required by selected features

Config Improvements
 Add “Listing Name” label to the directory form setup explicitly

 Optionally add a “type of directory” dropdown to help infer labeling if needed later
