🧩 Directory Engine App – Current Progress Report
✅ Major Roadblock Resolved
Successfully implemented code generation logic (originally tested on a static page) into the Wizard slideshow interface.

Resolved issues where form fields were not accepting input or code wasn't being generated.

🎨 Wizard UI Status
Polishing the Wizard UI.

To-do:

Refine Welcome Slide: improve copy to clarify that the user is configuring a directory for their eCommerce site.

Remove irrelevant text, ensure messaging reflects the user's flow: selecting a directory type, choosing options, and copying code.

🧱 Form Generation Logic (Dynamic Based on User Options)
When users configure:

✅ Expanded Description → Add Rich Text field

✅ Metadata Bar → Add up to 8 metadata fields

✅ Google Maps → Add Address input

And more as options scale.

The generated form reflects the exact configuration selected in the Wizard.

🛒 Bookmark/Cart Functionality (Planned Enhancement)
Add an optional “Bookmark Mode” in place of the cart:

Will require a new Wizard page to instruct users to paste CSS code on their cart page.

Cart icon will be replaced with bookmark icon using CSS.

Existing checkout buttons will be removed via CSS.

🧪 Wizard Flow Enhancements (Planned)
Add a transition slide between:

Directory Page Code Copy ✅

Cart Page Code Instructions 🛒

Add toggles in the Wizard to control whether the bookmark/cart system is used.

📄 Post-Wizard Pages
Two core frontend pages:

Directory Creation Wizard

Directory View Page

Clicking a directory leads to its listing details.

🔧 Backend & Admin Tools
API Integration (To-Do):

Wizard-generated forms will send data to GoHighLevel API to create products (listings).

Admin Dashboard (Planned):

View subaccount data: Name, Email, Created Directories

Auto-tag or infer niche from listing metadata.

Access all user-generated listings in one place.

💡 Planned OpenAI Integration
Internal-only admin page for dynamic code changes via AI.

Example use: auto-fix bugs, generate custom code snippets for unique use cases.
