Great ‚Äî you‚Äôre right at the doorstep. Since your redirect URI is set, your OAuth agent is coded, and the [HighLevel Authorization Flow](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/a04191c0fabf9-authorization) was followed, here‚Äôs exactly **what to do next to test if everything works.**

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL TESTING CHECKLIST

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: **Build the Authorization URL**

Manually construct this URL and open it in a browser (while logged into a HighLevel test account):

```
https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/authorize
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth/callback
  &scope=contacts.read contacts.write products.read products.write
  &state=test123
```

üîπ Replace:

* `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual HighLevel client ID
* `scope` with whatever scopes your app needs
* `state` with anything ‚Äî it‚Äôs optional but good for testing auth flow integrity

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: **Authorize the App**

1. Paste that URL in the browser
2. Authorize the app when prompted
3. You‚Äôll be redirected to:

```
https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth/callback?code=abc123&state=test123
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: **Check If Your Callback Works**

At this point, **your `/oauth/callback` route should:**

* Grab `req.query.code`
* Exchange it for an access token
* (Optionally) store the token + locationId + refresh token
* Redirect the user somewhere (like `/dashboard` or `/wizard`)

‚úÖ If you land on your dashboard and your console shows a token exchange ‚Äî **you‚Äôre in business.**

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: **Test an Authenticated API Call**

Try calling the products endpoint with the access token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/products/
```

You should get a list of products (or an empty list if none exist).

### üö´ Common Errors to Watch For

| Problem               | Message or Symptom                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Redirect URI mismatch | "redirect\_uri does not match"                 |
| Token exchange fails  | 400 Bad Request during token POST              |
| Scope denied          | 403 or empty data                              |
| Auth loop             | Callback doesn't redirect after token exchange |

---

### ‚úÖ If That Works ‚Äî You‚Äôre Done üéâ

Next you can:

* Automatically create products for the user
* Show connected status in your UI
* Store tokens for future use (with refresh logic)

Would you like me to help you:

1. Log the full token exchange in your Replit server?
2. Build a minimal test dashboard showing ‚ÄúYou are connected to HighLevel‚Äù with the user‚Äôs name/location?

Let me know where you want to go from here.
