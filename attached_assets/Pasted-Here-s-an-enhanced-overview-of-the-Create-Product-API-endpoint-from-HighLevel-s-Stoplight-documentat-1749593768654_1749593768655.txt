🔹 Variants Payload Example

"variants":[
  {
    "id":"...","name":"Color",
    "options":[{"id":"...","name":"Red"}, ...]
  },
  {
    "id":"...","name":"Size",
    "options":[{"id":"...","name":"Small"}, ...]
  }
]
Captures variant grouping and their possible values. IDs are essential for later price creation.

trackInventory: boolean

availableQuantity: integer, if inventory tracking is enabled

🔁 How It Works
After creating the product (with or without variants), you'll receive a product _id. Then, for simple products, create a single price linked to the product. For variant-enabled products, create multiple price entries — one per permutation of variant options — each with its own variantOptionIds, pricing, inventory, and recurrence settings.

🖼️ 3. Variant Image Management
For products with variants, you can upload specific images at the price (variant) level.

This uses a media update API, referencing the Price ID returned from the previous call.

📌 Summary Workflow
POST to Create Product

Specify all product-level data + variant structure (if applicable).

Response includes product._id.

POST to Create Price for Product, once per variant combination (or once for simple products)

Include product ID, pricing details, and optionally variantOptionIds, inventory tracking, and recurrence.

(Optional) Attach variant-specific image(s)

Use Price ID(s) along with media update endpoint.
