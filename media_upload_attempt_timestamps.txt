TIME CORRELATION ANALYSIS
-------------------------
1. OAuth installation successful at 01:29:44
2. Product creation working immediately at 01:30:27 (43 seconds later)
3. Media upload failing at 01:33:27 (3 minutes 43 seconds after OAuth)
4. Continued product success through 02:16:45 (47 minutes later)
5. Direct JWT error at 02:18:28 (48 minutes 44 seconds total)

CONCLUSION FROM TIMING
----------------------
- OAuth token valid and working for products continuously for 48+ minutes
- Media upload failed immediately when first attempted (3 minutes after OAuth)
- Same token worked for products before and after media upload failures
- Timing confirms token validity - issue is API-specific authentication
