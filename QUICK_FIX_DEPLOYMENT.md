# Quick Fix for Railway Deployment

## The Error
Railway can't find `@neondatabase/serverless` because the updated `package.json` hasn't been committed to GitHub yet.

## Immediate Solution

Replace your Railway backend's `index.js` with this version that captures OAuth tokens using existing dependencies:

**File to Update: `railway-backend/index.js`**

Use the content from `railway-backend-fixed-index.js` (created above) which:
- Captures OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens
- Stores installation data in memory (survives for session)
- Includes complete token exchange and user data fetching
- Adds debug endpoints to verify token capture
- Works with existing Railway dependencies

## Key Features Added
- **Token Storage**: Captures and stores access tokens, refresh tokens, user data, location data
- **Debug Endpoints**: `/api/debug/installations` to verify captured tokens
- **Complete OAuth Flow**: Full token exchange with GoHighLevel APIs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error management

## Verification
After updating `index.js`:
1. Test OAuth URL: `https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/oauth/url`
2. Complete OAuth installation via GoHighLevel
3. Check captured tokens: `https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/debug/installations`

## Result
Your Railway backend will immediately start capturing OAuth access tokens from marketplace installations without requiring new dependencies or GitHub commits.
