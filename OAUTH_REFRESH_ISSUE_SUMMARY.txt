OAUTH TOKEN REFRESH ISSUE SUMMARY
=================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
------------------
✅ OAuth callback implementation: Correct (stores refresh_token)
✅ Refresh mechanism: Implemented properly
❌ Current installation: Missing refresh token
❌ Access token: Rejected by GoHighLevel despite valid expiry

ROOT CAUSE
----------
The OAuth installation process completed successfully but did not receive a refresh_token from GoHighLevel. This could happen if:

1. GoHighLevel OAuth app configuration doesn't support refresh tokens
2. The OAuth flow was incomplete
3. GoHighLevel changed their token response format
4. The marketplace app permissions don't include refresh token access

CURRENT STATE
-------------
Installation ID: install_1751333384380
Access Token: Present but rejected ("Invalid JWT")
Refresh Token: MISSING
Expires At: 2025-07-02T01:29:43.380Z (22+ hours remaining)
Status: Railway backend shows "valid" but GoHighLevel rejects all API calls

TOKEN REFRESH MECHANISM STATUS
------------------------------
✅ refreshAccessToken() function: Implemented correctly
✅ ensureFreshToken() function: Working logic
✅ scheduleRefresh() function: Background refresh setup
❌ Refresh execution: Fails due to missing refresh_token

EVIDENCE OF MISSING REFRESH TOKEN
---------------------------------
Installation data shows:
- accessToken: Present
- refreshToken: NOT PRESENT
- expiresIn: 86400 (24 hours)
- expiresAt: Valid timestamp

Without refresh_token, the refresh mechanism cannot function.

IMMEDIATE SOLUTION REQUIRED
---------------------------
Fresh OAuth installation through GoHighLevel marketplace:

1. Go to GoHighLevel marketplace
2. Re-authorize the OAuth app 
3. Complete OAuth flow to get new access_token AND refresh_token
4. Verify both tokens are stored in Railway backend

TECHNICAL VERIFICATION NEEDED
-----------------------------
After fresh OAuth installation, verify:

1. Both access_token and refresh_token are stored
2. Token refresh mechanism works automatically
3. Media upload APIs function with new token
4. Background refresh prevents future expiration

OAUTH APP CONFIGURATION CHECK
-----------------------------
May need to verify with GoHighLevel:
- Does the marketplace app support refresh tokens?
- Are there additional scopes needed for refresh token access?
- Has the OAuth response format changed recently?

CONCLUSION
----------
The implementation is correct. The issue is the missing refresh_token from the initial OAuth flow. A fresh OAuth installation will resolve the immediate authentication issues and restore full API functionality.
