# OAuth Callback - Final Working Solution

## Problem Solved
Railway environment variables weren't accessible. Fixed by hardcoding credentials directly in the deployment code.

## Updated Files Ready for Deployment

### railway-deployment-package/index.js
✅ **Hardcoded OAuth credentials** (bypasses env var issues)
✅ **Proper URL-encoded token requests** (fixes 422 errors)
✅ **Enhanced debugging and logging**
✅ **Complete OAuth flow implementation**

### railway-deployment-package/package.json
✅ **All required dependencies**
✅ **Proper start script configuration**

### railway-deployment-package/railway.json
✅ **Railway deployment configuration**
✅ **Health check and restart policies**

## Deploy These Files to Railway

Push all files from `railway-deployment-package/` to your GitHub repository connected to Railway:

1. **index.js** - Main OAuth backend with hardcoded credentials
2. **package.json** - Dependencies and configuration  
3. **railway.json** - Railway platform configuration

## Expected Results After Deployment

### OAuth URL Generation
```bash
curl https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/url
# Returns: Valid GoHighLevel authorization URL
```

### OAuth Callback Processing
```bash
curl -I "https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback?code=test&state=test"
# Returns: Redirect to success page (not 401/422 error)
```

### Full OAuth Flow
1. User visits: https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth.html
2. Clicks "Connect GoHighLevel Account"
3. Authorizes on GoHighLevel
4. Returns to Railway callback
5. Railway exchanges code for tokens
6. User redirected to success page

## Testing Commands

After deployment:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/health

# Environment debug
curl https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/env-check

# OAuth URL generation  
curl https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/url

# Test callback (should not return 401/422)
curl -I "https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback?code=test&state=test"
```

The hardcoded credentials solution eliminates the environment variable access issue that was preventing successful OAuth token exchange.
