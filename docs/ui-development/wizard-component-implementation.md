# Wizard Component Implementation

## Overview
The wizard component was built to guide users through the Go HighLevel Directory integration configuration process. It features a step-by-step interface with smooth transitions, responsive design, and a multi-step form experience that dramatically simplifies the configuration process.

## Core Features
- Multi-step navigation system with progress indicators
- Smooth horizontal slide transitions between steps
- Consistent layout regardless of content length
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fully customizable with theme support
- Built with accessibility in mind

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Animation Consistency
**Problem:** Initial animations had slides moving inconsistently, with vertical jumping occurring between slides of different heights.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented a fixed-layout container architecture with absolute positioning
- Used a minimum height container to maintain spatial consistency
- Switched from spring physics to tweened animations for smoother transitions
- Added explicit control of vertical positioning during transitions

### Challenge: Navigation Button Positioning
**Problem:** Navigation buttons would sometimes appear in inconsistent positions due to varying content length.

**Solution:**
- Removed absolute positioning of buttons
- Added consistent padding to cards
- Positioned navigation buttons below each card with fixed margins
- Made navigation container part of the step content flow

### Challenge: Scroll Handling
**Problem:** Individual slides had their own scrollbars, creating a confusing user experience.

**Solution:**
- Removed overflow handling from individual slides
- Let the main page handle scrolling naturally
- Added sufficient padding to ensure content is properly displayed
- Used minimum height constraints instead of fixed heights

### Challenge: Step-to-Step Transition Logic
**Problem:** The initial implementation used a complex direction-based animation that was creating inconsistent transitions.

**Solution:**
- Simplified transition logic with consistent enter/exit directions
- Implemented AnimatePresence with "wait" mode for cleaner transitions
- Used key-based rendering to ensure proper component lifecycles
- Created dedicated animation profiles for both enter and exit states

## Code Structure

### Main Components
1. **ConfigWizard** - The wrapper component that manages state and transitions
2. **WizardStep** - Individual step containers with consistent styling
3. **AnimatePresence** - Framer Motion component handling smooth transitions

### Key Animation Properties
```tsx
<motion.div 
  key={`step-${currentStep}`}
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 100 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  exit={{ opacity: 0, x: -100 }}
  transition={{ type: "tween", duration: 0.4, ease: "easeInOut" }}
  className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
>
```

### Layout Strategy
We use a combination of:
- Fixed container dimensions for consistent positioning
- Absolute positioning for slides to prevent layout shifts
- Naturally flowing content within each slide
- Navigation buttons that consistently appear below content

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Progress Indicators:** Added dot indicators to show position in the wizard
2. **Clear Navigation:** Intuitive back/next buttons with appropriate disabling
3. **Smooth Motion:** Animations that guide the eye to the next step
4. **Consistent Spacing:** Careful padding and margin choices to maintain rhythm
5. **Mobile Friendly:** Responsive design that works on all device sizes

## Future Improvements

1. **Keyboard Navigation:** Add keyboard shortcuts for advancing/returning
2. **Form State Preservation:** Maintain form values when navigating back/forth
3. **Validation Indicators:** Show step completion status in progress indicators
4. **Branching Logic:** Support conditional steps based on previous choices
5. **Save & Resume:** Allow saving configuration progress and returning later

## Implementation Tips

1. Always use `key` props for consistent animations
2. Test on various window sizes to ensure responsive behavior
3. Keep animation durations between 300-500ms for best UX
4. Use `ease: "easeInOut"` for more natural-feeling transitions
5. Consider reduced motion preferences for accessibility
