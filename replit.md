# GoHighLevel OAuth Marketplace Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack marketplace application that provides OAuth integration with GoHighLevel and a universal API system for accessing GoHighLevel endpoints. The application enables users to authenticate with their GoHighLevel accounts and perform various operations through a unified API interface.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application built with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript/Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Configured for Replit autoscale deployment
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration with GoHighLevel

## Key Components

### Backend Architecture

**Express Server (`server/index.ts`)**
- Main server entry point handling API routes
- OAuth callback management
- Universal API routing system

**Database Layer**
- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts` with user and OAuth installation tables
- **Connection**: Neon PostgreSQL serverless connection (`server/db.ts`)
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage operations (`server/storage.ts`)

**OAuth System**
- GoHighLevel OAuth 2.0 implementation
- Token storage and refresh management
- User session management with JWT
- Installation tracking for marketplace apps

**Session Recovery System**
- Embedded CRM tab session restoration across devices
- Cookie-independent authentication for iframe embedding
- Multi-method user identification (User ID, Location ID, Installation ID)
- Database-driven session recovery using existing OAuth installations
- Automatic detection and recovery for cleared cookies or browser restrictions
- Cross-device compatibility without re-authentication requirements

**Universal API System**
- Dynamic routing for all GoHighLevel API endpoints
- Configuration-driven endpoint management
- Automatic authentication injection
- Comprehensive error handling

### Frontend Architecture

**React Application**

3. **API Request Processing**
   - Frontend makes requests to `/api/ghl/*` endpoints
   - Middleware validates OAuth tokens
   - Universal router matches endpoint configuration
   - Parameters extracted and validated
   - Request forwarded to GoHighLevel with authentication
   - Response processed and returned to frontend

4. **Database Operations**
   - User data stored in PostgreSQL
