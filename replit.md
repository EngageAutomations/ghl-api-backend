# GoHighLevel OAuth Marketplace Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack marketplace application that provides OAuth integration with GoHighLevel through a Railway-Replit bridge system. The application enables users to authenticate with their GoHighLevel accounts and perform various operations through a unified API interface.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with a hardcoded bridge system for Railway integration:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application built with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript/Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Railway Bridge**: Hardcoded OAuth credential system bypassing environment variable issues
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration with GoHighLevel via bridge endpoints

## Railway-Replit Bridge System

### Architecture
- **Railway Backend**: Requests credentials from Replit bridge endpoints
- **Replit Bridge**: Provides secure credential endpoints at `/api/bridge/*`
- **Hardcoded Implementation**: No manual configuration required for installations

### Key Bridge Endpoints
- `GET /api/bridge/oauth-credentials` - Provides OAuth credentials to Railway
- `POST /api/bridge/process-oauth` - Processes authorization codes
- `GET /api/bridge/installation/:id` - Returns installation status

### Update Process
Use delete + create method for reliable file updates:
1. Delete existing endpoint file: `rm filename`
2. Create updated file with new implementation
3. Changes automatically reflect in GitHub and Railway integration

## Key Components

### Backend Architecture

**Express Server (`server/index.ts`)**
- Main server entry point handling API routes
- Bridge endpoint integration for Railway communication
- Universal API routing system

**Bridge System (`server/bridge-endpoints.ts`)**
- OAuth credential provisioning for Railway backend
- Authorization code processing and token exchange
- Installation data management and status tracking

**Database Layer**
- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts` with user and OAuth installation tables
- **Connection**: Neon PostgreSQL serverless connection (`server/db.ts`)
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage operations (`server/storage.ts`)

**OAuth System**
- GoHighLevel OAuth 2.0 implementation via bridge
- Token storage and refresh management through bridge endpoints
- User session management with JWT
- Installation tracking for marketplace apps

### Frontend Architecture

**React Application**
- Vite-based build system
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- React Query for API state management

**UI Components**
- Comprehensive component library using Radix UI primitives
- Consistent design system with CSS variables
- Responsive design patterns

### Key Features

**Bridge-Based OAuth Integration**
- Railway requests credentials from Replit endpoints
- Automatic token exchange through bridge processing
- Secure credential handling without environment variable dependencies
- User account linking via processed installations

**Universal API Router**
- Single endpoint handles all GoHighLevel APIs
- Dynamic parameter extraction
- Automatic location ID injection
- Scope-based access control

## Data Flow

1. **OAuth Authentication via Bridge**
   - Railway backend requests credentials from `/api/bridge/oauth-credentials`
   - User initiates OAuth through GoHighLevel marketplace
   - Railway forwards authorization code to `/api/bridge/process-oauth`
   - Bridge processes token exchange and creates installation record

2. **API Request Processing**
   - Frontend makes requests to `/api/ghl/*` endpoints
   - Middleware validates OAuth tokens
   - Universal router matches endpoint configuration
   - Parameters extracted and validated
   - Request forwarded to GoHighLevel with authentication

3. **Database Operations**
   - User data stored in PostgreSQL
   - OAuth installations tracked with tokens via bridge system
   - Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations

## External Dependencies

**Core Framework Dependencies**
- Express.js for backend API server
- React for frontend user interface
- Vite for build tooling and development server

**Database & ORM**
- PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Database migrations support

**Authentication & API**
- GoHighLevel OAuth 2.0 integration via bridge system
- JWT for session management
- Axios for HTTP client operations

## Deployment Strategy

**Replit Deployment**
- Autoscale deployment target
- Multi-port configuration (3000, 5000, 8080)
- Automated build and start scripts
- Bridge endpoint hosting for Railway integration

**Railway Integration**
- Bridge endpoints provide OAuth credentials
- No environment variable configuration required
- Automatic credential provisioning through API calls
- Hardcoded system requiring no manual setup

## Current Status (June 25, 2025)

**Railway Backend:** Enhanced version 5.3.0 successfully deployed and operational
