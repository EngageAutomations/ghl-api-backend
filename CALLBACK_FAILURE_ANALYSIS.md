# OAuth Callback Failure Analysis - Current Status

## Investigation Results

### Backend Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Service**: Secure OAuth Backend v3.0 running correctly
- **Environment Variables**: All 3 GHL variables accessible (clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri all true)
- **OAuth URL Generation**: Working with correct new URL `oauth-backend-production-66f8.up.railway.app`

### Callback Test Results: ❌ STILL FAILING
- **Error**: 302 redirect to `oauth-error?error=UnAuthorized!&details=401`
- **GoHighLevel API**: Responds correctly (confirms credentials are valid)
- **Root Cause**: Token exchange still failing despite environment variables being accessible

## Critical Discovery

The backend has all credentials available but the callback still fails. This indicates one of two issues:

### Issue 1: Redirect URI Mismatch
The OAuth URL shows the new redirect URI: `https://oauth-backend-production-66f8.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback`

But GoHighLevel may still have the old redirect URI configured: `https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback`

**Action Required**: Update GoHighLevel app configuration to use the new Railway URL.

### Issue 2: Authorization Code Validation
Even with correct credentials, the token exchange fails. This suggests:
- GoHighLevel is sending the callback to the correct URL
- But the authorization code validation fails during token exchange
- This could be due to timing issues or code expiration

## Verification Steps

1. **Check GoHighLevel App Settings**: Ensure redirect URI matches `oauth-backend-production-66f8.up.railway.app`
2. **Test with Real OAuth Flow**: The test with `test_code` is expected to fail - need real authorization code
3. **Check Backend Logs**: Railway deployment logs would show the actual error during token exchange

## Backend Configuration Status
- ✅ All environment variables accessible
- ✅ Secure OAuth backend deployed
- ✅ OAuth URL generation working with new URL
- ❌ Token exchange failing (likely due to redirect URI mismatch in GoHighLevel)

The technical infrastructure is correct. The issue is likely a configuration mismatch between the new Railway deployment URL and the GoHighLevel app settings.
