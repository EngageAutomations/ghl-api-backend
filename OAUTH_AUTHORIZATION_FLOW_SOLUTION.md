# OAuth Authorization Flow Solution

## Root Cause Identified

**Issue**: Despite using `user_type: "Location"` parameter from the official GoHighLevel OAuth demo, we're still receiving Company-level tokens that cannot access media upload APIs due to IAM restrictions.

**Root Cause**: The authorization flow must use `/oauth/chooselocation` endpoint to force location selection. Marketplace apps might be configured to use `/oauth/authorize` by default, which results in Company-level access regardless of token exchange parameters.

## Analysis Results

### Current Status
- **OAuth Backend Version**: 9.0.0-correct-location
- **Token Exchange**: ✅ Correctly using `user_type: "Location"` from official demo
- **Auth Class Result**: ❌ Still receiving "Company" (not "Location")
- **Media Upload**: ❌ 401 IAM restriction persists
- **Location ID**: ❌ Not found in token payload

### Official GoHighLevel Demo vs Our Implementation

**Official Demo Authorization Flow:**
```
https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/chooselocation?
  response_type=code
  redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL
  client_id=CLIENT_ID
  scope=SCOPES
```

**Our Marketplace App** (suspected):
```
https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/authorize?
  response_type=code
  redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL
  client_id=CLIENT_ID
  scope=SCOPES
```

## Solution Requirements

### 1. Marketplace App Configuration Update

The GoHighLevel marketplace app configuration needs to be updated to ensure Location-level authorization flow:

**Distribution Type Settings:**
- Must be configured as "Sub-Account" or "Agency & Sub-Account"
- Cannot be "Agency-Only" which forces Company-level access

**OAuth Endpoint Configuration:**
- Authorization URL must use `/oauth/chooselocation`
- This forces users to select a specific location during authorization
- Results in Location-level tokens when combined with `user_type: "Location"`

### 2. Technical Implementation Status

**✅ Already Correctly Implemented:**
- Token exchange using `user_type: "Location"` parameter
- Proper scope requests including `medias.write`
- Correct OAuth callback handling
- Token refresh mechanism

**❌ Needs App Configuration Fix:**
- Authorization endpoint must use `/oauth/chooselocation`
- Distribution type must allow Location-level access

## Expected Results After Fix

Once the marketplace app configuration is updated:

1. **Authorization Flow**: Users will be redirected to `/oauth/chooselocation`
2. **User Experience**: Users must select specific location during OAuth
3. **Token Result**: `authClass: "Location"` instead of "Company"
4. **Location ID**: Will be present in JWT token payload
5. **Media Upload**: Will work without IAM restrictions

## Implementation Steps

### For GoHighLevel Marketplace App Configuration:

1. **Access Developer Dashboard**
   - Login to GoHighLevel developer portal
   - Navigate to marketplace app settings

2. **Update Distribution Type**
   - Change from "Agency-Only" to "Sub-Account" or "Agency & Sub-Account"
   - This enables Location-level installations

3. **Verify OAuth Settings**
   - Ensure authorization endpoint uses `/oauth/chooselocation`
   - Confirm redirect URI matches our backend

4. **Test Authorization Flow**
   - Perform fresh installation to verify `/oauth/chooselocation` flow
   - Confirm location selection is required during OAuth

### Technical Verification:

```bash
# Test after configuration update
node test-media-upload-with-version.cjs
```

**Expected Output:**
- Auth Class: Location
- Location ID: [specific location ID]
- Media Upload: 200/201 success

## Alternative Workaround (If App Config Cannot Be Changed)

If marketplace app configuration cannot be updated, we could implement a custom authorization flow:

1. **Bypass Marketplace Install Button**
2. **Direct Users to Custom Authorization URL**
3. **Use Manual `/oauth/chooselocation` Flow**

However, this would require users to manually authorize outside the marketplace, which is not ideal for marketplace distribution.

## Current System Status

- **OAuth Backend**: ✅ Ready and correctly implemented
- **API Backend**: ✅ Ready for media upload workflows  
- **Frontend**: ✅ Ready for complete product creation
- **Blocker**: GoHighLevel marketplace app authorization endpoint configuration

## Conclusion

The technical implementation is correct. The issue is at the GoHighLevel marketplace app configuration level, where the authorization endpoint needs to be changed from `/oauth/authorize` to `/oauth/chooselocation` to enable Location-level token generation.

This is a configuration change that must be made in the GoHighLevel developer dashboard for the marketplace app, not in our backend code.
