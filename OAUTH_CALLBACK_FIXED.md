# OAuth Callback Issue Resolved

## Problem Solved ✅

The OAuth callback failure has been fixed. The issue was in the `server/ghl-oauth.js` configuration file where the redirect URI was set to the old Railway URL instead of your main domain.

## What Was Fixed

**Before:**
```javascript
redirectUri: 'https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback'
```

**After:**
```javascript
redirectUri: 'https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth/callback'
```

## Verification Results

- **Callback Handler**: ✅ Working (returns 200 status)
- **OAuth Route**: ✅ Active at `/oauth/callback`
- **Redirect URI**: ✅ Correctly configured
- **Scopes**: ✅ Product-related permissions set

## Test Your OAuth Flow

Your OAuth system is now ready. Use these correct install links:

**Standard GoHighLevel:**
```
https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/oauth/chooselocation?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdir.engageautomations.com%2Foauth%2Fcallback&client_id=68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4&scope=products%2Fprices.write+products%2Fprices.readonly+products%2Fcollection.write+products%2Fcollection.readonly+medias.write+medias.readonly+locations.readonly+contacts.readonly+contacts.write
```

**Whitelabel:**
```
https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/chooselocation?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdir.engageautomations.com%2Foauth%2Fcallback&client_id=68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4&scope=products%2Fprices.write+products%2Fprices.readonly+products%2Fcollection.write+products%2Fcollection.readonly+medias.write+medias.readonly+locations.readonly+contacts.readonly+contacts.write
```

## Expected Flow

1. User clicks install link → GoHighLevel authorization page
2. User authorizes → GoHighLevel redirects to `dir.engageautomations.com/oauth/callback`
3. Your application processes callback → Token exchange with correct redirect URI
4. Success → User redirected to your application

The OAuth callback should now complete successfully without the "callback_failed" error.
