# Custom Domain Solutions for Replit Apps

## Current Situation
- Replit primary domain: `62a303e9-3e97-4c9f-a7b4-c0026049fd6d-00-30skmv0mqe63e.janeway.replit.dev`
- Custom domain added: `listings.engageautomations.com` (returning 404)
- Cannot make custom domain primary due to Replit limitations

## Solution 1: Use Both Domains (Recommended)

Your app will work on both URLs:
- **Primary**: Your Replit URL (works immediately)
- **Custom**: `listings.engageautomations.com` (for marketing/professional use)

### Benefits:
- No downtime or deployment issues
- Professional custom domain for marketing
- Reliable Replit URL as backup
- Both domains serve identical content

### Implementation:
- Custom domain routing already configured in your code
- App detects which domain is being used
- Same marketplace experience on both URLs

## Solution 2: Use Custom Domain for Marketing

Even if the custom domain shows 404 currently, you can:
- Use `listings.engageautomations.com` in marketing materials
- Set up a redirect from custom domain to Replit URL
- Configure DNS to point custom domain to Replit deployment

## Solution 3: External Proxy/CDN

Use a service like Cloudflare to:
- Point `listings.engageautomations.com` to your Replit URL
- Handle SSL certificates and routing
- Provide custom domain functionality

## Current Status Check

The 404 error suggests the custom domain DNS is resolving but Replit isn't serving your app content on it. This might resolve itself as DNS propagates, or may require Replit support.

## Recommendation

Proceed with your current setup:
1. Use the Replit URL for immediate access
2. Configure OAuth for both domains
3. Test custom domain periodically as DNS settles
4. Market using the custom domain for professional appearance

Your app is fully functional and ready for use on either domain.
