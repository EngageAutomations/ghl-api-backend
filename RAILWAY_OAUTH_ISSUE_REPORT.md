# Railway OAuth Issue Resolution Report

## Root Cause Identified
Railway is connected to a separate `oauth-backend` repository (v1.5.0), not this Replit repository. Changes made in Replit workspace cannot be pushed due to Git protection.

## Current Status
- Railway backend version: 1.5.0-modular  
- OAuth callback response: "OAuth not configured"
- Missing environment variables: GHL_CLIENT_ID, GHL_CLIENT_SECRET

## Solution: Environment Variables (Option B)
Instead of pushing code changes, configure OAuth credentials as Railway environment variables.

### Required Railway Environment Variables:
```
GHL_CLIENT_ID=68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4
GHL_CLIENT_SECRET=[secure value from Replit secrets] 
GHL_REDIRECT_URI=https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback
```

### Implementation Steps:
1. Railway Dashboard → Project → Variables
2. Add environment variables listed above
3. Redeploy current backend (automatically applies variables)
4. Test OAuth callback - should process instead of returning "OAuth not configured"

### Benefits:
- Secure credential storage in Railway vault
- No code changes required
- Works with existing oauth-backend repository
- Maintains modular architecture

### Verification:
After environment variables are set, test with:
```
https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback?code=e1d3fb0ace06e31ae2f8d2114ab3bc33e97ac36a
```
Should process authorization code instead of returning "OAuth not configured".

## Why Git Changes Don't Reflect
Replit workspace has Git protection preventing pushes to GitHub. Railway deploys from separate oauth-backend repository, not this workspace.
