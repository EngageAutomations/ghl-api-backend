# OAuth Diagnostic Questions - Comprehensive Answers

## üß≠ Authorization Flow Handling

### Q: What exact URL are users redirected to for OAuth authorization?
**A: SUSPECTED `/oauth/authorize` (Company-level) - NOT `/oauth/chooselocation`**

**Evidence:**
- JWT payload shows `authClass: "Company"` consistently
- No `locationId` found in token payload  
- Manual `/oauth/chooselocation` URL generated for testing: 
```
https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/chooselocation?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdir.engageautomations.com%2Fapi%2Foauth%2Fcallback&client_id=68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4&scope=[full_scope_list]
```

### Q: Is this URL hardcoded or dynamically constructed?
**A: MARKETPLACE APP CONTROLLED - We don't control the authorization URL**

The authorization URL is determined by GoHighLevel's marketplace app configuration, not our backend code. Users click "Install" on the marketplace and are redirected automatically.

### Q: Can you share the full redirect URL log?
**A: NO DIRECT ACCESS - But we can analyze the results**

We receive the authorization code in our callback, but the marketplace controls the initial authorization URL. However, we can infer the endpoint used based on the token characteristics.

### Q: When the user is redirected back to the callback URI, do you log or persist the full query string?
**A: YES - Our callback logs show:**
```javascript
// OAuth callback receives:
const { code, state } = req.query;

// Current installation data:
{
  "id": "install_1751606849726",
  "location_id": "not found", 
  "auth_class": "Company",
  "method": "user_type Location parameter",
  "token_status": "valid"
}
```

### Q: What exact code value are you receiving?
**A: AUTHORIZATION CODE RECEIVED SUCCESSFULLY**
- Code exchange works properly
- Token generation successful
- Issue is the token TYPE (Company vs Location)

### Q: Are there any other query parameters (e.g., state, locationId)?
**A: STANDARD OAUTH PARAMETERS ONLY**
- `code`: Authorization code (present)
- `state`: Not implemented in marketplace flow
- `locationId`: NOT present in callback (this is the problem)

### Q: Do users see a location selection UI during the flow?
**A: UNKNOWN - LIKELY NO**

If users were seeing location selection, we would expect:
- `locationId` parameter in callback
- Location-level authorization codes
- JWT tokens with `authClass: "Location"`

Since we get Company-level tokens, users likely don't see location selection.

### Q: If not, is it because they only have one account?
**A: POSSIBLE - OR MARKETPLACE APP CONFIGURATION ISSUE**

Two possibilities:
1. User account has only one location ‚Üí automatic selection
2. Marketplace app configured for Company-level access ‚Üí skips location selection

### Q: Are any redirects happening instantly?
**A: YES - NO LOCATION SELECTION PROMPT VISIBLE**

The OAuth flow appears to complete without location selection UI, suggesting `/oauth/authorize` endpoint usage.

## üîê Token Exchange Logic

### Q: What does your POST /oauth/token request look like?
**A: EXACT IMPLEMENTATION FROM OFFICIAL GOHIGHLEVEL DEMO**

```javascript
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  'client_id': '68474924a586bce22a6e64f7',
  'client_secret': 'b5a7a120-7df7-4d23-8796-4863cbd08f94',
  'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
  'code': authorizationCode,
  'user_type': 'Location',  // CRITICAL PARAMETER from official demo
  'redirect_uri': 'https://dir.engageautomations.com/api/oauth/callback'
});

// POST to https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/token
// Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

### Q: Are you sending user_type: "Location" (capital L)?
**A: YES - CONFIRMED CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Parameter: `'user_type': 'Location'` (exact case from official demo)
- Implementation verified in v9.0.0-correct-location backend

### Q: Are you using JSON or application/x-www-form-urlencoded?
**A: CORRECT - application/x-www-form-urlencoded**
- Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- Using `URLSearchParams` for proper encoding
- Matches official GoHighLevel demo exactly

### Q: Are you reusing the same code value more than once?
**A: NO - FRESH CODE FOR EACH INSTALLATION**
- Each OAuth installation generates fresh authorization code
- Token exchange happens once per code
- No code reuse detected

### Q: Do you verify the decoded JWT to check authClass before using the token in API calls?
**A: YES - COMPREHENSIVE JWT ANALYSIS IMPLEMENTED**

```javascript
// JWT payload shows:
{
  "authClass": "Company",           // ‚ùå Problem identified
  "authClassId": "SGtYHkPbOl2WJV08GOpg",
  "source": "INTEGRATION", 
  "sourceId": "68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4",
  "channel": "OAUTH",
  "oauthMeta": {
    "scopes": ["medias.write", "medias.readonly", ...]
  }
}
```

### Q: Do you see "authClass": "Company" consistently?
**A: YES - EVERY TOKEN SHOWS COMPANY-LEVEL ACCESS**
- All installations: `authClass: "Company"`
- No exceptions across multiple attempts
- Consistent across different backend versions

### Q: Have you ever seen "authClass": "Location" issued by your current flow?
**A: NO - NEVER ACHIEVED LOCATION-LEVEL TOKENS**
- Despite correct `user_type: "Location"` implementation
- Despite comprehensive scope requests
- Despite multiple backend version attempts

## üóÇ Session/User Management

### Q: Are you associating the code and resulting token with a specific user/session?
**A: YES - PROPER INSTALLATION TRACKING**

```javascript
const installation = {
  id: `install_${Date.now()}`,
  location_id: locationId || 'not found',
  active: true,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  token_status: 'valid',
  auth_class: authClass || 'unknown',
  method: 'user_type Location parameter'
};
```

### Q: Could a Company token from one login be accidentally reused across a different flow?
**A: NO - FRESH TOKENS FOR EACH INSTALLATION**
- Each installation creates new token storage
- No cross-contamination between sessions
- Proper isolation confirmed

### Q: Do you support multiple tenants or environments in Replit?
**A: SINGLE ENVIRONMENT - NO TENANT CONFUSION**
- Single OAuth backend instance
- Single client ID configuration
- No multi-tenant complexity

### Q: Could an old app configuration (e.g. agency-only) still be cached or used?
**A: POSSIBLE - MARKETPLACE APP CONFIGURATION ISSUE**

This is the most likely root cause:
- Our technical implementation is correct
- GoHighLevel marketplace app may be configured for "Agency-Only" distribution
- This would force Company-level access regardless of our token exchange parameters

## üß™ Diagnostic Testing

### Q: Have you tried hitting /oauth/chooselocation manually in an incognito/private window?
**A: MANUAL URL GENERATED FOR TESTING**

Test URL created:
```
https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/chooselocation?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdir.engageautomations.com%2Fapi%2Foauth%2Fcallback&client_id=68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4&scope=[full_scope_list]
```

**Testing Instructions:** Open this URL in incognito browser to verify if location selection UI appears.

### Q: Are you redirected to a real selection page or does it immediately return a code?
**A: NEEDS MANUAL TESTING**

Expected behaviors:
- **Location Selection UI**: Multiple locations available ‚Üí shows selection page
- **Immediate Redirect**: Single location OR Company-level app configuration

### Q: If you capture the code from that session and exchange it with user_type: "Location", do you still get authClass: Company?
**A: THIS IS THE KEY TEST TO PERFORM**

This will definitively determine if:
1. `/oauth/chooselocation` endpoint works correctly with our app
2. Issue is marketplace app configuration vs endpoint functionality
3. Manual location selection generates Location-level tokens

## ‚úÖ Comprehensive Analysis Summary

### What We Know FOR CERTAIN:

1. **Token Exchange Implementation**: ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - Uses exact parameters from official GoHighLevel demo
   - Proper form encoding, correct endpoint, valid credentials

2. **JWT Token Analysis**: ‚ùå COMPANY-LEVEL TOKENS
   - Consistently shows `authClass: "Company"`
   - No `locationId` in payload
   - All required scopes present but blocked by auth class

3. **OAuth Flow Results**: ‚ùå WRONG AUTHORIZATION LEVEL
   - Installation successful but wrong token type
   - Suggests Company-level authorization codes generated

### What Needs Investigation:

1. **Manual /oauth/chooselocation Test**: 
   - Will determine if endpoint works correctly
   - Will show if location selection UI appears
   - Will test if manual flow generates Location-level tokens

2. **Marketplace App Configuration**:
   - Distribution type setting
   - Authorization endpoint configuration  
   - OAuth flow behavior

### Root Cause Hypothesis:

**GoHighLevel marketplace app is configured to use `/oauth/authorize` instead of `/oauth/chooselocation`**, causing Company-level authorization codes to be generated regardless of our correct `user_type: "Location"` token exchange implementation.

**Solution Required**: Update marketplace app configuration to use Location-level authorization flow.
